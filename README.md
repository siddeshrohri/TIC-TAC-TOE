# TIC-TAC-TOE

Part 1:

Implement required functions in the C source code files as indicated.
Use the provided data structure for storing the game state.
Add functions if needed, along with appropriate function prototypes in the header files.
Refer to the provided source code for more information about each file's purpose.
Output to the screen must follow a precise format defined in the code.
Pass the pre-defined tests.

Part 2:

This part extends the Part 1 solution to a more general case.
The program should now accept two integer command line arguments: the grid size (3 to 8) and the winning line length (3 to chosen grid size) from the User.
Extend the board display to accommodate the increased size while maintaining the same formatting as the existing 3x3 implementation.
Generalize the conditions for winning and drawing a game accordingly.
